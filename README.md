# Graphs, Networks & Games

Graphs, Networks & Games was one of the first programs that I have ever written in the past 2 years of my Computer Engineering academic life. It is a school project (or assignment, I would say) done by me and a colleague while we were in a Software Construction course. The project basically implements graphs (Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix) along with searching algorithms (Breadth First Search and Depth First Search) and rely on those to implement a small game called Boggle with a provided simple Java GUI.
